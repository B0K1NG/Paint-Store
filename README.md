# Paint-Store
In this project, I will follow step-by-step instructions to improve a vibrant, color-rich web page for a home paint business. It displays information about using color in a home and color swatches with varying lightness, saturation, and hue.

The page is almost ready to be published. I'll be making the following color-related changes:

Exchange some named colors with hexadecimal color values.
Add some semi-transparent overlays to the banner and footer using RGBA.
Fill in the first color column of the swatch samples using HSL colors.
